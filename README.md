Keep track of servers from the command line, current version is **0.0.1**

Initially used to keep track of the University of Utah's CADE lab 1 machines

### Roadmap
* **0.0.x:** Unstable and not to be used by anybody unless they hack on it
* **0.1.x:** Take a list of servers and update the load periodically
* **0.2.x:** More configuration
    * Which load one wants
    * What kind of authentication to use (point to a private key or ask for password)
